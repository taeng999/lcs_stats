## Introduction

In this project, I am using Riot API to investigate the LCS Spring Split in 2018. The investigation will determine each professional player's weakness and strengths. The ultimate goal for this project is to build a recommender system for each League of Legend's professional team to select optimal laners.

Currently, in League of Legends e-sports community, each team can only have two players from different countries because of visa issues. With the recommender system, each team could distribute right amount of money for players including US citizen and foreign players.

### Overview
The data and stats will be only that has happened in 2018 LCS regular season and playoff. Regular season had 9 weeks, and in each week, there were 10 games. Regular season games had 'Best of 3' rule in terms of deciding the winner. After the regular season, the top teams move onto playoffs, which the winners are decided by 'Best of 5' method.

## Data

Most of the data collected are from calling Riot API. Some additional metrics are collected by webscrapping in third party web that analyzes the player in 2018.
