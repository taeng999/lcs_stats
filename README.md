## Introduction

In this project, I am using Riot API to investigate the LCS Spring Split in 2018. The investigation will determine each professional player's weakness and strengths. The ultimate goal for this project is to build a recommender system for each League of Legend's professional team to select optimal laners.

## Data

Most of the data collected are from calling Riot API. Some additional metrics are collected by webscrapping in third party web that analyzes the player in 2018.

## Analysis
**TODO**
1) Collect data
2) Investigate each player
3) team ranking
4) Analysis
